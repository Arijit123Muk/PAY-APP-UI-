# PAY-APP-UI
I have created a few screens of a paying app in Flutter. The application that consists 2 screens mainly the main screen and the qr scanner region.
<p>
In the main screen there are 2 button <b>Scan and Pay</b> and <b>Received Money</b>.
If pressed in the <b>Scan and Pay</b> it will move to the next screen,i.e, <b>ACCEPTED HERE</b> and here you can scan your screen.
